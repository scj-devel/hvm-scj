/**
 * This class cannot be directly instantiated by the application; 
 * hence there are no public constructors. Every <code>Schedulable</code> 
 * object is provided with one instance of <code>PrivateMemory</code> ,
 * its root private memory area. A schedulable object active within a private
 * memory area can create nested private memory areas through the 
 * <code>enterPrivateMemory</code> method of <code>ManagedMemory</code>. 
 * <p>
 * The rules for nested entering into a private memory are that the private memory area
 * must be the current allocation context, and the calling schedulable object has to be
 * the owner of the memory area. The owner of the memory area is defined to be the
 * schedulable object that it was provided for.
 *   
 * @version 1.2; - December 2013
