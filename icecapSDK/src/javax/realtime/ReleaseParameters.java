/**
 *  All schedulability analysis of safety critical software is performed off line. <br>
 *  Although the RTSJ allows on-line schedulability analysis, SCJ assumes any such analysis is
 *  performed off line and that the on-line environment is predictable. Consequently,
 *  the assumption is that deadlines are not missed. <br>
 *  However, to facilitate fault-tolerant applications, SCJ does support 
 *  a deadline miss detection facility at Levels 1 and 2. <br>
 *  SCJ provides no direct mechanisms for coping with cost overruns. <p>
 *  The <code>ReleaseParameters</code> class is restricted so that the parameters cannot be changed or queried.
 *  
 * @version 1.2; - December 2013
