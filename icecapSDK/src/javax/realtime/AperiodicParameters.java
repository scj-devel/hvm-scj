/**
 * SCJ supports no detection of minimum inter-arrival time violations, 
 * therefore only aperiodic parameters are needed. Hence the RTSJ 
 * <code>SporadicParameters</code> class is absent. <br>
 * Deadline miss detection is supported. <br>
 * 
 * The RTSJ supports a queue for storing the arrival of release events in 
 * order to enable bursts of events to be handled. This queue is of length 1 in SCJ. 
 * The RTSJ also enables different responses to the queue overflowing. 
 * In SCJ the overflow behavior is to overwrite the pending release event if there is one.
 *
